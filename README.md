SystemMonitoring
================
This package contains a postmaster filter which provides a primary email interface to system monitoring applications. For Icinga and Nagios, deeper integration is included. Automatic linking between tickets and CIs is available for users of the [ITSM Configuration Management add-on](https://doc.znuny.org/manual/itsmfeatures/index.html). Based on the system monitoring notification, the incident stage of a CI is also changed.
